<h3 style="color=purple">Introduction</h3>
<p>
Human connectivity is one of the major factors for productivity, especially in a school environment. The development of this watch is aimed at increasing productivity by increasing the communication of both staff and students in the community. The watch is centred at creating a connected school community that will provide real time communication to enhance the educational experience for students, staff and management regardless of their location within the school premises. This will enable members of the community to share information in real time. The watch is designed with the Arduino pro-micro as the main processor. The watch will leverage WI-FI technology using the ESP8266-01 WI-FI module for connecting to a network and receiving of messages. The watch will be connected to a secured intranet network. The watch has an average response time of approximately twenty-five (25) seconds to filter the data sent by the server and extract the message. Upon testing the design, the overall current draw of the watch was found to be approximately 78 mA. A lithium battery with a current capacity of 750 mAH was used for this project, which means that the battery will last for approximately nine hours.
